                  Thanks to advances in reproductive medicine and pre-natal care, more
                  women today are able to conceive, maintain pregnancies, and deliver
                  babies – even premature and multiple births. Sometimes, however, these
                  babies have special needs that require high quality medical care
                  enhanced with the latest technology. Even when the pregnancy has been
                  problem free, babies can be born with unexpected conditions that
                  require expert care. The St. Luke’s Neonatal Intensive Care Units
                  (NICU) at St. Luke’s Allentown Campus, St. Luke’s University Hospital
                  – Bethlehem and St. Luke’s Anderson Campus are designed to provide a
                  high level of care for babies and their families.
